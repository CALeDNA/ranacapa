## Beta Diversity via Homogeneity of Variances 

In addition to similarity or dissimilarity in species composition between samples, beta diversity can also be thought of as the difference in heterogeneity within habitats (or other groups of samples). To do this, we can test if there are differences in the species composition variances for two or more groups of samples.  For example, ten samples are collected from Habitat 1 where each sample contains 50 species, but only 25 of those are shared across the ten samples. In Habitat 2, ten samples are collected and contain 50 species, but 45 of those are shared across the ten samples. Habitat 1 will have a greater variance in species composition than habitat two. More details on this method are available in [Anderson et al. 2006](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4d5e/dc3b0893ab72630094cd299572a8f9bd8d94.pdf).
