## Beta Diversity via Homogeneity of Variances 

In addition to similarity or dissimilarity in species composition between samples, beta diversity can also be thought of as the variance in species composition between groups of samples (analogous to  [Leveneâ€™s test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levene%27s_test)).  We can test if there are differences in the species composition variances for two or more groups of samples.  For example, ten samples are collected from habitat one where each sample contains 50 species, but only 25 of those are shared across the ten samples. In habitat two ten samples are collected and contain 50 species, but 45 of those are shared across the ten samples.  Habitat one will have a greater variance in species composition then habitat two. More detaisl on this method are available in [Anderson et al. 2006](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4d5e/dc3b0893ab72630094cd299572a8f9bd8d94.pdf).
