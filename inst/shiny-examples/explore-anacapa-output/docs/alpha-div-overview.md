## Background on alpha diversity

In ecology, the term [alpha diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_diversity) refers simply to the diversity observed in a single sample. Although this may seem like a very simple concept, it turns out that there's many ways to consider diversity. The most obvious metric, of course, is simply to count the number of species found in a sample. This is the metric calculated with the 'Observed' option on the left.

Beyond this obvious choice of just counting up the number of species, there's a variety of related metrics that can be used to calculate alpha diversity. Consider, for instance, the following situation:

You are comparing two communities. Each community has 3 species in it. In the first community, each species is represented by 100 individuals each; in the other, there are 290 individuals of Sp A, 9 of Sp B, and just 1 of Sp C. Clearly, there is something different about the diversity of these two communities even though they house the same number of species.

This is the type of diversity captured by a metric known as [Shannon diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#Shannon_index). We present this option on the left, and encourage readers to explore the many other ways of measuring alpha diversity ([link](http://www.marinespecies.org/introduced/wiki/Measurements_of_biodiversity), [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/biological-diversity/lecture/fchbT/3-4-a-diversity)).

In addition to inspecting alpha diversity per sample, you also have the option to view the alpha diversity summarized by one of the characteristics of the plots. You can choose the characteristic from the dropdown list on the left.
