## Background on Beta Diversity

Alpha diversity lets us consider the diversity within any given sample.  A second way to consider the diversity among samples is to investigate the extent to which samples differ in their species composition. For example, two sites might hold the same ten species- both are equally diverse, and not at all dissimilar. A different pair of sites might hold ten species each, but it may be a completely different list of ten between the two sites- these two are equally diverse, but quite dissimilar! Quantifying differences in species composition between sites is at the crux of [Beta Diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_diversity). 

Beta Diversity is a complex topic and there are [many ways to measure it](https://methodsblog.wordpress.com/2015/05/27/beta_diversity/). In fact, beta diverseity methodology and intereprations of patterns in beta diversity remain are an active area of research in ecology (e.g. [Anderson et al. 2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01552.x), and new metrics for quantifying beta diversity continue to be developed (e.g. [Ricotta 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.2980)). 

In this app we consider some simple ways of exploring beta diversity. All of these methods can be calculated using one of two measures of dissimilarity:

- The [Jaccard index](https://cals.arizona.edu/classes/rnr555/lecnotes/10.html), which incorporates differences in species presence or absence between sites, but nut differences in abundance, or   

- The [Bray-Curtis index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bray%E2%80%93Curtis_dissimilarity), which integrates information about species abundance. 

We recommend using the Jaccard index, as eDNA-based abundance data might not always be reliable, but encourage you to explore both indices. Do you get the same results using both? If not, what might be driving the disparity?

In the [PCoA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling#Types) plot below, sites are plotted such that points that are near each other on the plot are more similar in their taxonomic composition; those that are distant have very different species lists.
