## Background on Beta Diversity

Alpha diversity lets us consider the diveristy within any given sample.  A second way to consider the diversity among samples is to consider how", strong("dissimilar"), "samples are from each other. For example, two sites could hold ten species each- and it might be the same ten in both cases. A different pair of sites might hold ten species each, but it may be a completely different list of ten between the two sites. Quantifying differences between sites (i.e. low difference between the first pair of sites, which hold the same ten species; higher difference between the second pair) is at the crux of [Beta Diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_diversity). 

Although it may seem simple at first, the calculation of Beta Diversity is still quite an unresolved topic in ecology- there's many ways for samples to be different from each other! Some of the many ways Beta diversity can be calculated are reviewed in the following
