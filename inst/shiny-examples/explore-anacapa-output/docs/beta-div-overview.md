## Background on Beta Diversity

Alpha diversity lets us consider the diveristy within any given sample.  A second way to consider the diversity among samples is to consider how **dissimilar** samples are from each other. For example, two sites might hold the same ten species- both are equally diverse, and not at all dissimilar. A different pair of sites might hold ten species each, but it may be a completely different list of ten between the two sites- these two are equally diverse, but quite dissimilar! Quantifying differences between sites (i.e. low difference between the first pair of sites, which hold the same ten species; higher difference between the second pair) is at the crux of [Beta Diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_diversity). 

Beta Diversity is a complex topic and there are many ways to measure it [link ](https://methodsblog.wordpress.com/2015/05/27/beta_diversity/); [link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01552.x). In this app we consider one group of methods which involves plotting the multi-dimensionla dissimilarity between a pair of sites. Dissimilarity can be calculated as either the [Jaccard index](https://cals.arizona.edu/classes/rnr555/lecnotes/10.html), which does not incorporate differences in species abundances between sites, or the [Bray-Curtis index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bray%E2%80%93Curtis_dissimilarity), which does integrate information about species abundances. In the [PCoA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling#Types) plot below, sites are plotted such that points that are near each other on the plot are more similar in their taxonomic composition.
