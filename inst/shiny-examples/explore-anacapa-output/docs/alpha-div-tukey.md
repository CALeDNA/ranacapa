## Post-hoc tests 

The ANOVA table above can only reveal whether there is a difference in diversity among sites- but it doesn't tell us *which* sites are different from each other. In other words - we might know from the ANOVA above that Sites A, B, and C are not identically diverse, but we don't know whether diversity in Site A 
is different from that in Site B, and so on. One way to explore this is via a [post-hoc Tukey test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukey%27s_range_test), which compares each group against each other. The results from the Tukey test are presented below:
